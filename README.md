# Integrating Third Party APIs
author: Troy Washington

## Hi BC, page is work in progress. I've got to comeback and resubmit this one, I found no need to leave documentation for test cases when all I did was fetch and display data from an API. I did error handling for unsuccessful API responses but not much else was done on the page.  

Third-party APIs used:
